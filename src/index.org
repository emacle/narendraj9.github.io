Hi!

I am a Software Developer by profession, an /Emacs/ devotee and an untalented
poet. I intend to use this space for writing about things that I think I have
understood well in the hope that they may be helpful to others (including my
future self).

To get in touch, email me at narendraj9 at gmail dot com.
