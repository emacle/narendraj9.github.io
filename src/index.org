Hi!

I am a Software Developer by profession, an /Emacs/ devotee and an untalented
poet. I intend to use this space for writing about things that I think I have
understood well in the hope that they may be helpful to others (including my
future self).

To get in touch, email me at narendraj9 at gmail dot com. Here is my [[file:assets/data/resume.pdf][ResumeÂ´.]]
