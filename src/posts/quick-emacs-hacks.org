#+TITLE: Emacs: Quick Hacks
* Intro
I spend most of my time inside Emacs â€• the truly extensible environment. I keep
adding new functions/commands to my Emacs configuration that help me accomplish
just about anything I would like to. In this post, I am sharing with you two
such functions.
* Code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :session vicarious :exports both :results output
  (defun do-when-idle (f g interval)
    "Call F when idle for INTERVAL seconds and then G when there is activity.
  Thanks to Michael Heerdegen <michael_heerdegen@web.de>."
    (letrec ((run-timer-fun (lambda ()
                              (run-with-idle-timer interval
                                                   nil
                                                   (lambda ()
                                                     (funcall f)
                                                     (add-hook 'post-command-hook
                                                               activity-fun)))))
             (activity-fun (lambda ()
                             (remove-hook 'post-command-hook activity-fun)
                             (funcall g)
                             (funcall run-timer-fun))))
      (funcall run-timer-fun)))
#+end_src
I use the above function for things like
#+name: `do-when-idle` usage
#+begin_src emacs-lisp  :session vicarious :exports both :results output
  (do-when-idle #'coin-ticker-mode
                (lambda ()
                  (coin-ticker-mode -1))
                60)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :session vicarious :exports both :results output
  (defvar limit-usage (make-hash-table :test 'equal))
  (defun limit-usage (command max-minutes)
    "Limit usage of COMMAND to only once in MAX-MINUTES."
    (advice-add command
                :around
                (lambda (orig-fn &rest args)
                  (let* ((hash-key (symbol-name command))
                         (last-ts (gethash hash-key limit-usage))
                         (gap-in-minutes (and last-ts
                                              (/ (time-to-seconds
                                                  (time-subtract (current-time)
                                                                 last-ts))
                                                 60))))
                    (if (and gap-in-minutes (< gap-in-minutes max-minutes))
                        (message "Last Accessed: %s Time to go: %.2f minutes"
                                 (format-time-string "%FT%T%z" last-ts)
                                 (- max-minutes gap-in-minutes))
                      (apply orig-fn args)
                      (puthash hash-key (current-time) limit-usage))))))

#+end_src

I use the above function for limiting how frequently I check email:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp  :session vicarious :exports both :results output
;; Check mail not more than once every 4 hour.
(limit-usage #'gnus (* 4 60))
#+end_src
* Conclusion
Emacs is configurable in almost every aspect. Besides the advantages, the only
problem with it is that it encourages dislike for the defaults. This costs me
some time every week if not everyday.
