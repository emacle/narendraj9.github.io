Most applications need to take care of authorization. Authorization is the
answer to the question of whether a request is permitted or not. We will look
at different models of authorization using a meta-model in this article. I am
going to use [[https://casbin.org/][Casbin]] for concrete examples. You can experiment with example
model definitions using [[https://casbin.org/editor/][Casbin Model Editor]].

* PERM Meta-Model
A instance of PERM (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers) describes how these four
kinds of entities interact with each other to build something that can used for
authorization. First let's describe each of these entities and then look at an
example model built using them.

- Request :: Information about the access request. A simple request would be a
             tuple with the subject, action and the resource.
             A concrete request model can have resources such as
             [[https://github.com/intel/rmd][physical hardware components like CPU caches]] or logical entities
             built out of persisted data like customers in a CRM system.
             ~r = {sub, action, resource}~
- Policy :: A model of what can constitute a rule in the system, e.g., an
            administrator should be allowed to read user info.
            ~p = {sub, action, resource}~
- Matchers :: A model of how requests and policies are matched.
              The simplest example would be using equality for matching
              requests and policies if the above models for those are used.
              ~m = r.sub == p.sub && r.action == p.action && r.resource == p.resource~
              Given a request, a value is produced for every policy using this
              matcher expression. So, we have a =p.eft= value for every policy
              in our policy set. We haven't defined instances of policies
              yet. We have only defined how those instances would look like,
              i.e. the policy model.
- Effect :: A model for combining/reducing policies that match a given request
            to a final result. Value of evaluating the matcher expression is
            available in =eft= field in every policy.
            ~e = some(p.eft == allow)~

The diagram below illustrates how a request is authorized using a model
based on PERM.

* Model Definitions
Here is the complete model definition for ACL-based authorization:

#+name: ACL based authz model
#+begin_src conf :results verbatim drawer
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
#+end_src

For such a model, the policies that define authorization rules will look like
#+name: Policies for ACL
#+begin_src conf :results verbatim drawer
p, alice, data1, read
p, bob, data2, write
#+end_src


If we wish to allow everything to the =admin= user, all we need to change is
the definition of the matcher:
#+name: New matcher allowing admin users everything
#+begin_src conf :results verbatim drawer
[matchers]
m = r.sub == admin || (r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act)
#+end_src

To enable simple attribute based access control, we need access to the actual
data in the resource object. For example if we only want to allow requests
which are initiated by the owner of the resource, the matcher expression would
change to:

#+name: New matcher for simple attribute based access control
#+begin_src conf :results verbatim drawer
m = r.obj.owner == r.sub && (r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act)
#+end_src

The PERM meta-model is flexible enough to allow us to switch to complex
authorization models even if we start with a simple model in the
beginning. An extension of the PERM model would be to allow materialized views
of the resource based on policies. This requires that the final result is a
resource rather than a boolean value. This might seem like a good idea in the
beginning but it seems to be mixing two different ideas:
- Allowing access to a resource
- Building an instance of a logical resource based on constraints or the
  context.

For example, let's say a hypothetical SaaS company needs to manage credits for
multiple applications that register themselves on their platform (Ola credits,
Uber credits). There can be a field in the User resource, say =credits=, which
has a list of credits (logically) for all these applications. Now, we must
ensure that credits for one application are not visible to any other
application. All applications have access to all other fields but this field
needs to be filtered. In my opinion, this field should have never been designed
such that it ends up with data for all applications while building the User
object/map/representation in memory. Share your thoughts about this in the
comments below.

* Conclusion
PERM is a flexible meta-model for building authorization models.
