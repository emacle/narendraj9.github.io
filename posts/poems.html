A few poems that I have written are here: <a href="http://narendraj9.blogspot.in">Words Paper and Life</a>

<h2 id="nostalgia"><a id="orgff5a2e9"></a>Nostalgia</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nostalgia">
<p>
Another day sinks and disappears,<br>
The slate gets a few more strokes.<br>
I think and wonder, an unending craving,<br>
Looking at the far-away mountains,<br>
Draped in snowy mist at a tempting distance--<br>
<i>Where would my heart find a better home?</i>
</p>

<p>
Like a childish belief in talks to a God,<br>
The presence of a bigger truth turns a myth everyday.<br>
Maybe there is no God in the bigger things,<br>
No wonders that only an eagle's eye would see.<br>
Maybe life is lived in little pieces only<br>
Of bursts of laughter or pangs of pain,<br>
Of silence-filled walks or smile-worn days.<br>
Maybe that's all there is to it.<br>
And maybe everything else just sets the backdrop<br>
Or I would wake up and smile one day<br>
Reading this page. Remembering this day.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1905717" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="departure"><a id="org1905717"></a>Departure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-departure">
<p>
Sails of my little boat flapping to the tunes of traveling winds,<br>
As I leave the realm of the known to walk with shaky feet again,<br>
Play a symphony that only aches my heart even more.<br>
I see in the distance, faces new. In the distance, faces old.<br>
There is heaviness in my heart for sure.<br>
And the chills can still reach my bones, silent and cold.<br>
But I walk this wire. I will be someone else again.<br>
Like all stories, written on oceanic tides,<br>
Mine would become a part of the shore, placid and earthed. [Sedimentary
Rock :-D]

<div id="outline-container-org9fdc2ea" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="a-lovely-day"><a id="org9fdc2ea"></a>A Lovely Day</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-lovely-day">
<p>
A clearer sky emblazoned with such beautifying cloudiness<br>
Roofs restlessness and more than a few endless chases.<br>
Within life's confused web, a resting plateau;<br>
Only plateaus, no peaks, I have learned.<br>
Another day would etch wrinkles on the face of time,<br>
Caresses on a wrinkled face, with wrinkled hands,<br>
My mind's box has it's own definition of beauty, it seems.<br>
I wonder and smile, I look look outside, close my eyes.<br>
The air is fresher, silence pleasant for a change.<br>
Today seems like one of those lovely days.

<div id="outline-container-org645347d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="whims"><a id="org645347d"></a>Whims</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-whims">
<p>
If I had wings, or the magic of a sorcerer's wand,<br>
Or the swiftness of my wandering thoughts,<br>
Or the strength of the never tiring winds,<br>
I would be there before you fall asleep tonight<br>
And let you know how in my mind, I caress your cheeks<br>
And what the word and signs, they all mean.
</p>

<p>
What I feel isn't the shallow whim of a wandering mind<br>
Which on time's call would fall into pieces<br>
But the steady calmness of a mind in rest<br>
Amid the million chases of these worldly worries.<br>
You are my resting stone, the silence and the song.<br>
But my love I am human, weak and strong, so are you.<br>
I need you close and I need your hands<br>
To hold me, to touch, to feel and see.<br>
How your eyes twinkle when they meet mine,<br>
Or how your lips taste in these chilly winters<br>
Or how your brows curl in a smile<br>
On the little foolishness your sweetest slave plays.<br>
But I don't want them now, and now<br>
Neither in the 'near' future if it means<br>
Saying no to my love for distance's sake<br>
When it can be, when it can be&#x2026;<br>
Truer a little farther in time.
</p>

<p>
So, my love I love, these gaps of silence and sleep<br>
Of the dormant and the dancing wishes of time<br>
Waiting to feel your lips on mine<br>
And my hands playing with those twines of hair.<br>
I will be there. Or I will take you here.<br>
Or we will have a world of a different attire<br>
Until my love, you say it's best<br>
And finally, you lay beside me under the covers<br>
And these blankets forget the smell of loneliness.
</p>

<h2 id="a-lost-poem"><a id="org7cb9bc0"></a>A Lost Poem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-lost-poem">
<p>
Places bathe in sunshine and shade.<br>
Structures gigantic, with time, decay.<br>
Beauty and colors fade, to my dismay.<br>
Each moment at its own pace<br>
Marches to the beats of an oldened drum. (let's name it "time")
</p>

<p>
Waves oceanic, they retreat<br>
After, with the shore, having a meet.<br>
Faces of the moon, shadowy afternoons,<br>
Songs of Silence, the vigor of vengeance,<br>
Fruits of a tree, the hum of a bee;<br>
With Time all fall into laps of change, you know.<br>
Amid these changes, I can assure<br>
My Love would stand brave and bold.<br>
As time would etch age on my face<br>
And weakness would crawl into my days,<br>
My hand would lay held out for you,<br>
My Love, I promise, agelessly true.<br>
My Raison D'etre! You are<br>
In my days and in my dreams;<br>
For none would be complete without thee<br>
Stay with me Stay with me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4a3ed8c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="eyes"><a id="org4a3ed8c"></a>Eyes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-eyes">
<p>
Eyes, those eyes, they say. They speak<br>
A language so foreign to me--<br>
A thousand words in a single blink;<br>
A song that I have been chasing.<br>
When they smile, curved the brows;<br>
Resembling pearls embedded in snow,<br>
All the seven wanderers, I know,<br>
Envy our little dusty globe!<br>
In bitter times, the twins they dive<br>
Into majestic oceans and seas.<br>
Ruby red, shiny wet<br>
Silencing every word meant to hurt.<br>
All my world of words won't suffice<br>
To be just with those two eyes.<br>

<h2 id="nostalgia-1"><a id="org081edfd"></a>Nostalgia</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nostalgia-1">
<p>
Amid a thousand passing seconds<br>
None of which dearer to the Gods,<br>
It's so strange of this human heart<br>
That only a few it adores.<br>
It could be her eyes;<br>
Could be some six year old's smile;<br>
Could be rainbows in the sky<br>
Or an equation after those years of time;<br>
Could be the sunshine<br>
Or that ball of snow that lovingly hit your face.<br>
Could be the water, cold and sweet and tastless at the same time.<br>
Or the fire that lets you read through darkness;<br>
It could be silence, void and complete and strange<br>
Or cheerful voices shouting at the top of their lungs.<br>
Could be just words, ink and paper and life<br>
Or the canvas you paint every night,<br>
Or be forgotten and remembered those dreams.<br>
But do those blind and deaf moments know<br>
How much of your life they have made?

<div id="outline-container-org7b80813" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="seclusion"><a id="org7b80813"></a>Seclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-seclusion">
<p>
A tryst, Of the silence and a few fleeting thoughts;<br>
Leaves a constellation of eerie knots.<br>
Am I a slave to the passing time<br>
Or the winds, not chariot mine?<br>
Stillness has answers that refuse;<br>
Maybe it is the seclusion, still and calm<br>
Or these words just smudge those lines.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb7de5b5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="love"><a id="orgb7de5b5"></a>Love</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-love">
<p>
Hunger timely fills my cage;<br>
Pain embraces me before the breakage;<br>
Restlessness finds me on a lonelier day;<br>
In silence, in chaos, in peace or in a war;<br>
My hands are never nearer never farther away.<br>
Why then love needs your presence today?
</p>

<p>
Your eyes, shinier and still&#x2013; yet not so --<br>
Lay their warmth upon my face;<br>
Your lips can sing to my heart's content<br>
Or march my soul to its death bed.<br>
Why my love, my love isn't love<br>
Until only you feel its feathers?
</p>

<p>
Sleep engulfs me after days exhaust my pace;<br>
Worlds wander distressed in the endless chase;<br>
Of silence and peace; In distress and disease.<br>
I am I in all of the chaos, my mind mine, not lost so<br>
For these mountains are its own, the rivers it has flown;<br>
Yet your presence softens its edge; tamed with a kiss<br>
And a gaze silences the curious; turns to prayers and a wish.<br>
What have you if not some beyond love<br>
That all the love within me isn't enough?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org97286a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="a-constellation-of-thoughts"><a id="org97286a7"></a>A Constellation of Thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-constellation-of-thoughts">
<p>
Looking at the starry sky tonight, I wonder<br>
How many worlds unknown to me, blossom and die.<br>
The silence, accompanied by the whisper of drunken winds<br>
Engulfs me with the same emotion I had in a crowded place<br>
Where my worlds weren't the twinkling spots on the blue muslin<br>
But faces in a hurry, faces painted with worries.<br>
Someone was on a run, someone else had the headphones on.<br>
One lost in glitter of passing days, the other in music<br>
That only lends one the numbness of thoughts.<br>
Someone smiled, secretly with a machine he owned,<br>
Someone else I saw was too young to understand<br>
But it seemed as if he was a lot wiser than me<br>
Unknown to things he can't change, worlds he can't gauge.
</p>

<p>
With all this complexity, unfathomable whose depth,<br>
Of the lives that live within me, of the ones with me,<br>
It's a strange force that leads us through our days.<br>
An eagle's eye might see the chaos of my world<br>
But my world isn't his. His worlds will never be mine.<br>
It's only in vague terms one can say<br>
About things that one finds hard to explain.<br>
Maybe it's the short length of my voyage so far<br>
Or maybe it is the bodily boundaries of the cage I wear.<br>
Or maybe I am left to adore in awe the creations of the Master<br>
Until the call that puts it to an end.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8bee46" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="from-the-light-of-polaris"><a id="orgb8bee46"></a>From the light of Polaris</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-from-the-light-of-polaris">
<p>
No new morrow would see me abandon your streets<br>
For I have lived there longer than I have lived.<br>
There may be no road ahead, only the endless sea<br>
With a lonesome traveler laying desirous stares<br>
On the setting Sun, as if it would rise in her world<br>
To have his message be reached, and felt.<br>
It may make no sense to the keepers of wisdom<br>
But I've never declared my being as wise<br>
For it has always been the foolish things<br>
That turned passing time to memories<br>
And the feet of the wise is shaky and meek<br>
When they say it's faith, and wisdom fleets.
</p>

<p>
No fears dwell these valleys I walk.<br>
Fearful are those with walls raised,<br>
Of wanting, or of loss;<br>
I have treasures that no one can steal<br>
And I hope you still believe in them.
</p>

<p>
This may never become a poem<br>
But then neither those that I have ever written are.<br>
Unlike those ramblings from all corners of my heart,<br>
Each word here holds a meaning, I assure<br>
For it's hard to say what I mean<br>
When it's not what you want.
</p>

<p>
I remember more than I thought I would<br>
Of the time we lived and the worlds we crafted.<br>
The last page of an old notebook still holds a little petal<br>
Dearer to me than all roses I have ever seen.<br>
I remember your eyes, when we met after days a few<br>
And how they were filled with an emotion I don't have a word for;<br>
The corners of my wandering mind still meet the traveler once I was<br>
Sometimes the walls bring smiles, sometimes a few regrets you know.
</p>

<p>
Smile, at least for once for all this world of words<br>
Stays in the realm of worthlessness<br>
Unless you let your lips curl as your mind reads<br>
And your eyes speak as if a young lover kissed them;<br>
Shyly blinking with a shimmer of heavens<br>
That's all I am wishing for. That's all this is for.

<h2 id="an-evening"><a id="org98d8ada"></a>An Evening</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-an-evening">
<p>
If you let me, I will be the wind to caress your face<br>
When the morning light shines with your hair.<br>
I will be the loving wetness on your cheeks<br>
Subliming and dissolving at the same time.<br>
I will be the silence that soothes your forehead<br>
With every line struggling to leave a mark;<br>
I will be the boredom of your days<br>
And the chaos of your celebrations.<br>
I will write my heart out on every stone you step upon<br>
And still be left with a million words to say.<br>
I will be the one you will want on every knock on the door<br>
And the smile that adores your face when it's known.

<h2 id="a-happy-day"><a id="org4035c8d"></a>A Happy Day</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-happy-day">
<p>
My laces to traveling shoes, yes, laces.<br>
I remember, Do I?, the song of the wind<br>
As we listened to the ticks from our pasts<br>
And dreamed of waves at our shore in the distance.
</p>

<p>
My flickering lights on a full-moon sky, yes, those lights.<br>
I still feel, Don't I do?, the woken up hair on my skin<br>
As I dived into your eyes, on a chilly morning bus ride<br>
And I hope I have told you happiness is when they shine.
</p>

<p>
My magic to a mundane day, yes magic, you know.<br>
Like a broken poem, a hopeless aim, a senseless song, secluded fame.<br>
Yes, magic.<br>
Yes, it's you! :)
